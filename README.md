## Directory Structure

### `algo`
This contains the algorithm(s) utilized for accelerating Blender's simulation process.

### `simulator`
The implementation of different simulation workflows are listed here, where the specific characteristics of each are embeded in the comments. 

### `utils`
This contains some debugging and analyzing tools.

## Setup

### Python-Based Simulator
The python implementation is written under python3.8 with numpy 1.20.1. 

## Workflow
